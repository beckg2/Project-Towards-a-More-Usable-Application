# Project-Towards-a-More-Usable-Application

Basic Requirements

Make enhancements to the HTML of templates, using better markup and adding classes or attributes as needed to create a more elegant visual presentation.

Use custom features of whatever templating language your application uses to create more functional and elegant interfaces. Identify and implement elements that may help with display or use.

Adjust Javascript to make sure that page and interface transitions call the appropriate animations and/or highlights. Be sure to highlight data and state changes.

Enhance style definitions as needed to provide the best possible user interface.
